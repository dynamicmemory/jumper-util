#JUMPER

The idea is instead of having to use **cd** to navigate between directories, I 
can just use "jmp <directory name>" and land straight in it. That's the basic 
idea atleast, which language to write it in and if I ever use it or find it useful
is a whole other question i'll answer shortly.

Currently only basic functionality works, will jump you straight to a
directory you name if its the only directory called that in your system.
Working on adding:
- multiple options for directories that have the same name.
- fav/jump list for tab complete 
- smart choice

No error protection at the moment, rough outline
